#### requirements
* Operating System: R can be installed on Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms.
*	Hardware Requirements: No specific hardware requirements. Performance improves with better hardware.
* Memory Requirements: 2 GB of RAM minimum recommended, 4 GB of RAM recommended for handling larger datasets.

#### download
To use R for data analysis, you will need to install both R and RStudio, a popular Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that makes using R easier. download, installation instruction can be found:https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/

#### package installation
R packages are collections of functions and data sets developed by the community that enhance Râ€™s functionality, allowing you to perform additional types of analysis or improve ease of use. For example, ```ggplot2``` enhances graphical capabilities, ```dplyr``` offers advanced data manipulation, and tidyr helps in organizing data.
